# ML_dog_intelligence

This first dataset provides insight into how intelligence and size may be connected in dogs. It includes information on dog breeds, including their size, how well they obey commands, and the number of repetitions required for them to understand new commands. This can help pet owners who are looking for a dog that fits their lifestyle and residential requirements.

In the second dataset, dog ownersâ€™ understanding of the daily behaviour of their dogs may be enhanced by movement measurements that can detect repeatable dog behaviour, such as levels of daily activity and rest as well as their changes. The aim of this dataset is to evaluate the performance of supervised machine learning methods utilising accelerometer and gyroscope data provided by wearable movement sensors in classification of seven typical dog activities in a semi-controlled test situation. Forty-five middle to large sized dogs participated in the study. Two sensor devices were attached to each dog, one on the back of the dog in a harness and one on the neck collar.
